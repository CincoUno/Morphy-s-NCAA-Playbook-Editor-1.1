Create a folder on your desktop or hard drive and call it PLAYBOOK EDITING. Within this, put this file. Within this folder, create a subfolder and name it CUSTOM PLAYBOOKS. Within that folder create another folder, say NCAA CUSTOM 1, or maybe OPTION PLAYBOOK or AIR RAID PLAYBOOK, and then drop the actual db file in that file. You put the db file in a folder within a folder because you might want to add plays to certain formations and that requires you to export CSV files. So it's best to have a folder that can house all of the CSV files for that particular playbook and the file itself.
